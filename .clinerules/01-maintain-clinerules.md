## Maintaining This Directory

**Important**: This `.clinerules` directory should be kept up-to-date as the project evolves:
- Add new patterns when they're established in the codebase
- Update guidelines when coding standards change
- Remove outdated rules that no longer apply
- Cline will automatically follow these rules, so keeping them current is crucial
